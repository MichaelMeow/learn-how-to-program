        <p>This week will focus on two important concepts front end developers use constantly: <strong>Responsive Design</strong> and a tool called <strong>Webpack</strong>. Before we begin, we want to give you a run-down of each (including some important notes on course structure):</p>
        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>One of the most important concepts introduced last week was <strong>mobile-first design</strong>. This is because more and more users access the web on mobile devices. One source, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/284202/mobile-phone-internet-user-penetration-worldwide/">Statista</a>, states:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>As of February 2017, mobile devices excluding tablets accounted for 49.73 percent of web page views worldwide. Asia and Africa had a higher than average mobile traffic share with 65.1 percent and 59.49 percent of mobile traffic respectively.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And this number is only projected to increase:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In 2020, the number of smartphone users worldwide is projected to reach 2.87 billion, up from 2.1 billion in 2016.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Because half or more of users view sites on smartphones, it&#39;s more important than ever that interfaces gracefully reconfigure themselves to fit all screen sizes.</p>
        <p>We&#39;ve already practiced <strong>media queries</strong> that do this. This week we&#39;ll explore more advanced features that allow applications to <em>dynamically</em> alter style and structure based on screen size. This study is called <strong>responsive design</strong>. We&#39;ll discuss things like writing code that elegantly rearranges and resizes content, special responsive considerations for images, writing responsive Sass, best practices for responsive designs, cutting-edge responsive CSS3 features, and more.</p>
        <h2>Development Environments</h2>
        <p>The second big concept we&#39;ll explore is Webpack. Webpack is a <strong>module bundler</strong>. This is a tool that collects all source code for a project, and concatenates it into one central file. This both dramatically decreases load time in the browser, and maintains an organized development environment. For these reasons, Webpack has exploded in popularity since its 2015 introduction and is now considered an industry standard for creating development environments. </p>
        <p>Because this tool is so prevalent, we thoroughly practice it in the JavaScript course all students take. However, Webpack is in <em>especially</em> high demand in front end development. We&#39;ve found that many (if not most) local front end job postings mention it. As such, it&#39;s important your portfolio contain examples of integrating Webpack with the front end-focused concepts of this course.</p>
        <p>But we felt it unfair to require front end studnets complete extra work in the JavaScript course, where Weback is usually introduced, to create these work examples. This would require extra hours spend on each JavaScript project, subtracting from the already-limited time to practice the complex concepts introduced in that course.</p>
        <p>Here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do instead: You&#39;ll receive early exposure to Webpack this week, beginning Monday evening, to craft portfolio projects that demonstrate high-demand front end skills. The trade-off? A few concepts in your first week of JavaScript will be review. Slightly more homework this week, in exchange for more review-oriented homework in three weeks, and a portfolio that will better match demands of the job market.</p>
        <h2>Independent Project Objectives</h2>
        <p>As always, we&#39;ll complete an independent project on Friday. This week&#39;s project will be evaluated on the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Development environment is fully-functional, including Webpack module bundling, and a development server.</li>
        <li>Design is responsive, and dynamically resizes into a mobile-friendly layout.</li>
        <li>Best practices of responsive design are followed, including using relative units, designing mobile layouts first, integrating media queries to dynamically reorganize and resize content, and integrating images fluidly.</li>
        <li>Styles are written in Sass syntax, and well-refactored using Sass functionality.</li>
        <li>Project is in a professional, portfolio-quality state.</li>
        <li>Project was submitted by the Friday deadline.</li>
        <li>Project demonstrates an understanding of this week&#39;s concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your project with an instructor using the correct terminology.</li>

      <div class="w2">
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/">Statista</a>, mobile internet traffic made up 52.64% of online traffic in 2017. They also report that over 3.8 billion people regularly used mobile devices to access the internet in 2018. Based on these numbers alone, it&#39;s overwhelmingly clear web users will continue viewing content on a variety of screen sizes. This means websites must ensure their content is presentable and functional on all possible viewport sizes.</p>
<p>This lesson will begin exploring how developers tackle this challenge, as we discuss <strong>responsive web design</strong>, what it means, and even observe example firsthand. Then in the next few lessons we&#39;ll review how to use things like <strong>relative units</strong>, <strong>media queries</strong>, and <strong>fluid images</strong> to begin making our own sites responsive to any screen size.</p>
<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>Around 2009, people began using words like <em>fluid</em>, <em>elastic</em>, and <em>liquid</em> to describe web layouts. Later in 2010 <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com">Ethan Marcotte</a> officially coined the term <strong>responsive web design</strong> in his article <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/"><em>Responsive Web Design</em></a>. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, an emergent discipline called <em>“responsive architecture”</em> has begun asking how physical spaces can respond to the presence of people passing through them...In their book <em>Interactive Architecture</em>, Michael Fox and Miles Kemp described this more adaptive approach as “a multiple-loop system in which one enters into a conversation; <em>a continual and constructive information exchange.</em>” I think that’s a subtle yet powerful distinction: rather than creating immutable, unchanging spaces that define a particular experience, they suggest inhabitant and structure can—and should—mutually influence each other.</p>
<p>This is our way forward. Rather than tailoring disconnected designs to each of an ever-increasing number of web devices, <strong>we can treat them as facets of the same experience.</strong> We can <strong>design for an optimal viewing experience, but embed standards-based technologies into our designs to make them not only more flexible, but more adaptive to the media that renders them.</strong> In short, we need to practice responsive web design. But how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Marcotte&#39;s original statement is dense, even challenging to understand upon first reading, know that its core idea is simple: <strong>User interfaces should flexibly adapt based on screen size, to offer users similar experiences regardless of their device.</strong></p>
<p>In his subsequent book, also titled <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design"><em>Responsive Web Design</em></a>, Marcotte explains how developers achieve this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what does it take to create a responsive design? Speaking
purely in terms of front-end layout, it takes three core
ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>A flexible, grid-based layout</li>
<li>Flexible images and media</li>
<li>Media queries, a module from the CSS3 specification</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2>Responsive Web Design In Action</h2>
<p>Since then, every major site has become responsive. Check out the following examples of what this looks like in action:</p>

<h3>More Live Examples</h3>
<p>Before moving on, try out some responsive designs for yourself too! Visit a few of the following links and manually adjust your browser window width to observe how their layouts change:</p>

<li>The <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/responsive-design/">Awwwards section for responsive design</a> contains many award-winning examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this certainly isn&#39;t limited to the sites above. Visit nearly any major site online and you&#39;ll see that resizing your viewport results in reorganization of content.</p>
<p>In the next lessons we&#39;ll begin reviewing the underlying principles of responsive design, before crafting our own responsive interfaces together.</p>

      <div class="w3">
        <p>In the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/ui-development-basics/value-units"><em>Value Units</em></a> prework lesson we discussed the term <strong>relative units</strong>, explaining:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Relative units...are relative to things like the parent container, an element&#39;s font size, or the size of the browser window. (For instance, if we specify an image should be <code class="prettyprint">50%</code> the width of its parent container, it will differ in size depending on the size of that parent!)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We learned that <code class="prettyprint">em</code>, <code class="prettyprint">rem</code>, <code class="prettyprint">vw</code>, and <code class="prettyprint">%</code> (percentage) values are relative because they flexibly change in relation to other elements (usually their parent). For example, if we declare a div should be <code class="prettyprint">50%</code> as wide as its parent, it doesn&#39;t matter if that parent is <code class="prettyprint">1000px</code> wide on a desktop, or <code class="prettyprint">200px</code> on a smartphone; the child div will always be half as wide.</p>
        <p>This dynamic flexibility makes relative units a crucial part of responsive design, because they automatically ensure elements maintain a size in consistent proportion with other elements, regardless of viewport size. This save us from writing tons of media queries to resize each individual item. In this lesson we&#39;ll discuss how to best use relative units to create responsive layouts.</p>
        <p>(If the concept relative units feels unfamiliar, review the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/ui-development-basics/value-units"><em>Value Units</em></a> lesson before continuing.)</p>
        <h2>Relative Units</h2>
        <p>Many relative units used in responsive design (besides viewport units) actually originate from the very first version of CSS! But their use in responsive design is considerably more far-reaching. As usage of relative units grows increasingly broad, best practices become more involved.</p>
        <p>Here are the most important best practices for relative CSS units in responsive design:</p>
        <h3>Use <code class="prettyprint">px</code> Units for Constant Sizing</h3>
        <p><strong>Always use <code class="prettyprint">px</code> units for elements that should stay the same dimensions regardless of viewport size.</strong> That is, if we <em>don&#39;t</em> want an item to resize with the viewport.</p>
        <p>Elements we want to stay consistent, regardless of viewport size, include things like the width of a document&#39;s first parent container (often denoted with the class <code class="prettyprint">container</code>), borders and padding, or the width of a line break.</p>
        <p>The CSS below, for instance, follows this rule:</p>
        <pre><code class="prettyprint lang-css">html {
          box-sizing: border-box;
          font-size: 100%;
        }

        *, *:before, *:after {
          box-sizing: inherit;
        }

        body {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
        }

        .container {
          border-left: 2px solid lightSeaGreen;
          border-right: 2px solid lightSeaGreen;
          margin: 0 auto;
          max-width: 1400px;
          padding: 15px;
        }

        .main-content {
          display: flex;
          flex-direction: column;
        }

        .content-box {
          width: 48%;
          justify-content: space-between;
        }
        </code></pre>
        <ul>
        <li><p><code class="prettyprint">px</code> creates rigid content values, like the <code class="prettyprint">max-width</code> and <code class="prettyprint">padding</code> of the parent <code class="prettyprint">.container</code>. The maximum is just that...the <em>maximum</em>, we don&#39;t want this upper limit to change in size.</p></li>
        <li><p>Styles for children of this parent <code class="prettyprint">.container</code> use relative values; primarily percentages. This ensures their size maintains a consistent, proportional relationship with the parent&#39;s size.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Avoid <code class="prettyprint">px</code> in Child Elements</h3>
        <p><strong>In child elements, use <code class="prettyprint">em</code>, <code class="prettyprint">rem</code>, percentages, or viewport units (<code class="prettyprint">vw</code>) whenever possible.</strong></p>
        <p>Using absolute units like <code class="prettyprint">px</code> on child elements can lead to pretty random numbers. These are called <strong>floating</strong> or <strong>magic</strong> numbers because they&#39;re difficult to understand almost immediately after they&#39;re written. As the <em><a href="https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/">Magic Numbers in CSS</a></em> article by Chris Coyier describes:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Despite the super fun sounding name, magic numbers are a bad thing...[they are] just some number plunked into the code that is probably vital to things working correctly but are very difficult for anyone not intimately familiar with the code to understand...</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here&#39;s an example of CSS that uses way too many hard-coded <code class="prettyprint">px</code> values:</p>

      <div class="w4">
        <p>In the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/responsive-design-development-environments/introduction-to-responsive-design"><em>Introduction to Responsive Design</em></a> lesson, we learned that responsive design is composed of three primary ingredients, as described by Ethan Marcotte:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A flexible, grid-based layout</li>
<li>Flexible images and media</li>
<li>Media queries, a module from the CSS3 specification</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This lesson will dive deeper into the third item on this list, <strong>media queries</strong>, and how to best utilize them in responsive design. The next lesson will discuss flexible grids, then we&#39;ll learn about flexible images in Tuesday&#39;s homework.</p>
<h2>Media Queries</h2>
<p>As discussed <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/building-layouts/viewports-and-media-queries">earlier in the course</a>, a <strong>media query</strong> is a block of CSS applied only when specific conditions about the user&#39;s viewport are true. This allows us to change layout structure and style based on viewport width. The point at which a condition becomes true, and the query&#39;s CSS is applied, is called the <strong>breakpoint</strong>.</p>
<h2>Determining Breakpoints</h2>
<p>Over time, phones, tablets and other devices have created widely-recognized pixel ranges often used in media queries. For example, <a href="http://screensiz.es/">as outlined here</a>, most tablets are between 600 and 900 pixels in portrait orientation. So you may assume that breakpoints should correspond exactly with these common device sizes.</p>
<p><strong>But that&#39;s actually a dangerously incorrect assumption!</strong> Determining where breakpoints should lie differs greatly between applications, and requires more careful thought and planning than referring to common screen sizes. Let&#39;s discuss best practices for effective breakpoints in responsive designs.</p>
<h3>Required Reading: <em>The 100% Correct Way to do CSS Breakpoints</em></h3>
<p>First off, read David Gilbertson&#39;s tips for constructing breakpoints in his article, <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862"><em>The 100% Correct Way to do CSS Breakpoints</em></a>.</p>
<h3>Breakpoint Best Practices</h3>
<p>As Gilbertson explains, configuring breakpoints is really tricky. Fortunately, there are rules we can follow to help:</p>
<h4>Content First</h4>
<p>Breakpoints should be determined based on the specific application&#39;s content, not an outside standard like common smartphone sizes. The breakpoints in Gilbertson&#39;s the article are a great guideline, but <em>your</em> breakpoints for <em>your</em> applications should be determined based on the needs of <em>your</em> unique content.</p>
<p>For example, if there&#39;s a high-resolution image we want featured prominently on a page, but a &#39;standard-issue&#39; breakpoint cuts it off or sizes it in an unflattering manner, that&#39;s a big indication we should <strong>make the breakpoint work for the content, instead of forcing the content into the breakpoint.</strong></p>
<h4><code class="prettyprint">min-</code> or <code class="prettyprint">max-width</code> for Mobile or Desktop</h4>
<p>Last week we learned how to follow mobile-first design, sketching and wireframing mobile layouts first, before desktop versions. But as long as we finalize mobile <em>designs</em> first, it doesn&#39;t actually matter which we <em>code</em> first. (But your future employer or internship company may have their own workflow preferences.)</p>
<p>And, conveniently enough, the version we opt to code first will dictate how we set breakpoints! Here are helpful rules to reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If you begin coding the mobile layout first, write breakpoints using <code class="prettyprint">min-width</code></strong>, because you&#39;ll be moving from smaller mobile screens up toward larger desktop screens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you start with desktop, write them with <code class="prettyprint">max-width</code></strong>, because you&#39;ll move from a larger desktop viewport into a smaller mobile screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(If <code class="prettyprint">min-width</code> and <code class="prettyprint">max-width</code> don&#39;t ring a bell, review rules for these expressions in the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/viewports-and-media-queries"><em>Viewports and Media Queries</em></a> lesson.)</p>
<h4>Other Considerations</h4>
<p>But these are just the basics of responsive breakpoints and media queries. You&#39;ll see lots of tutorials online suggesting different approaches. We think the recommendations here are easiest and most efficient for beginners, but as you grow more comfortable with responsive design, feel free to try different approaches!</p>

      </div>
      <div class="w5">
        <p>As we&#39;ve already discussed, responsive web layouts are composed of three primary ingredients:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>A flexible, grid-based layout</li>
      <li>Flexible images and media</li>
      <li>Media queries</li>
      </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The last lesson discussed media queries. But what about that first item on this list? In this lesson we&#39;ll discuss what a <strong>flexible grid</strong> is, what they do, and how they helps create the dynamically-responsive layouts users have grown to expect.</p>
      <h2>Flexible (or Fluid) Grids</h2>
      <p>The term <strong>flexible grid</strong> was also introduced by Ethan Marcotte (yep, same person who coined <em>responsive design</em>) in an article titled <em><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">Fluid Grids</a></em>. The article tells the story of redesigning a client&#39;s content-heavy site. The client wanted their design to resize with the browser window, but this created a serious hurdle for Marcotte...you see, there simply weren&#39;t any grid-based responsive options in 2009. They were all <em>very</em> rigid. So he had to develop his own.</p>
      <p>After a series of attempts he found a solution:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>...as I was working on relative font sizing, that’s when it hit me: every aspect of the grid--and the elements laid upon it--can be expressed as a <strong>proportion relative to its container</strong>...This will allow us to convert our design’s pixel-based widths into percentages, and keep the proportions of our grid intact as it resizes.</p>
      <p>In short, we’ll have a <strong>fluid grid</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is an important distinction. <strong>Fluid/flexible grids <em>do not</em> inherently refer to flexboxes, or even a feature called CSS grids</strong> (we&#39;ll explore what CSS grids are in the next lesson). They&#39;re a <em>general type</em> of layout that has existed long before either of these features. We could create a flexible grid using CSS grid or flexbox features, sure, but they&#39;re not the only way.</p>
      <p>(Essentially, just keep in mind &quot;flexible grid&quot; is a general term, whereas CSS Grid and Flexbox are specific features in CSS.)</p>
      <p>Marcotte provides an example in his <em><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">Fluid Grids</a></em> article. Check out the following web layout. Pretty standard, right?</p>
      <p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/doxonggjpaighhk/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-09%20at%203.01.56%20PM.png?raw=1" width="100%"></p>
      <p>Here&#39;s that same layout with grid lines superimposed:</p>
      <p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8l2jtha1nqrhl0j/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-09%20at%203.02.15%20PM.png?raw=1" width="100%"></p>
      <p>Notice how the different elements and areas of the layout line up perfectly on this grid. Then notice how each area of the grid retains proportions as the viewport resizes:</p>
      <p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mfjiyspxssj9j4s/flexible-grid-example-gif.gif?raw=1" width="100%"></p>
      <p>As we can see, <strong>fluid grids</strong> are the cumulative use of relative values <em>and</em> a media query-based grid system. The goal with any grid layout is to be structural rigid enough to organize content cleanly and consistently, yet still flexible enough to dynamically resize for any viewport.</p>
      <p>Grids are a construct that abstract other tools. So it&#39;s admittedly difficult to write rules for how they should be used. There&#39;s no single best practice for flexible grid-based layouts. It&#39;s dependent on needs of the specific project. That said, the priorities of flexible grids lie on a spectrum;</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>On one end exists the snappy, rigid design focusing on displaying content in the clearest, most consistent way possible.</p></li>
      <li><p>On the other end exist flowing grids that maintain the same viewport ratio regardless of screen size. These grids gently decrease or increase their content sizes as the browser window expands or contracts, as opposed to &quot;snapping&quot;.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>And responsive layouts can exist anywhere between these two ends of the spectrum.</p>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>Here are two examples that prioritize these goals differently. Visit each and expand/contract your browser window to observe how they change:</p>
      <h3><a href="http://deutscheundjapaner.com/">Deutsche &amp; Japaner</a></h3>
      <p>This slick agency site has an highly-stylized grid system brimming with media. As we resize the browser window, we see grid sections are dictated by relative values (pictures, for example, take up 100%, 50%, or 25% of the screen width). At media breakpoints the grid changes shape drastically.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://www.npr.org/">NPR News</a></h3>
      <p>In contrast, NPR&#39;s homepage uses a simple grid with lots of margin to keep content cleanly separated. Notice there are also fewer breakpoints. This prevents article titles from &quot;snapping&quot; or &quot;jumping&quot; out of visual focus, as they would if the grid changed drastically over more than three breakpoints.</p>
      <p>What other differences do you notice between these two? Is there one you&#39;re more drawn toward? Do you think different content is best represented by different approaches? How will the grids <em>you</em> use maximize user experience?</p>
      <p>This is the question inherent in responsive design.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="w6">
        <p>Now that we&#39;ve been introduced to CSS grids, let&#39;s explore how they before we begin creating our own grids in class tomorrow.</p>
  <p>This lesson will walk through CSS grid terminology, anatomy, and the properties and style declarations used to create a grid.</p>
  <h2>Grid Anatomy and Terminology</h2>
  <p>Let&#39;s first clarify CSS grid anatomy and terminology. Some of this will be review from the video in the previous lesson.</p>
  <p>Consider the following diagram from gitconnected&#39;s article <em><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/css-grid-layout-fast-start-81b8943dee3b">How to Get a Quick Start with CSS Grid Layout</a></em>:</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c3orco8zu3xbg24/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-30%20at%209.23.00%20AM.png?raw=1" width="100%"></p>
  <p>Let&#39;s walk through each part depicted here:</p>
  <h3>Grid Container</h3>
  <p>A <strong>grid container</strong> is the element that contains the grid itself. We create it by applying a <code class="prettyprint">display: grid;</code> style to it, like this:</p>
  <pre><code class="prettyprint lang-css">.example-grid {
    display: grid;
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>As soon as an element is a grid container, all its children automatically become <strong>grid items</strong>, and span the full width of the parent grid container.</p>
  <h3>Grid Items</h3>
  <p><strong>Grid items</strong> are simply the items organized by the grid. They must be direct children of the grid container. All direct children of grid containers are automatically grid items.</p>
  <h3>Grid Lines</h3>
  <p><strong>Grid lines</strong> are the intersecting lines that make up the grid itself.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>There are <strong>column lines</strong> that run top-to-bottom;</p></li>
  <li><p>and <strong>row lines</strong> that run right-to-left, as seen in the image above.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Grid Cell</h3>
  <p>A <strong>grid cell</strong> is an individual &quot;box&quot; in the grid (one of the nine squares composing the grid seen above).</p>
  <h3>Grid Track</h3>
  <p>A <strong>grid track</strong> is the space between two adjacent grid lines. Each entire row or column in the grid is considered a grid track.</p>
  <h3>Grid Area</h3>
  <p><strong>Grid area</strong> refers to the combined area of multiple cells (but it must be a rectangle, and cannot be an L-shape. See diagram above.)</p>
  <h3>Grid Gap</h3>
  <p><strong>Grid gap</strong> refers to optional space between each column and row, as emphasized in the image below (it&#39;s not included in the diagram above). Sometimes specifically referred to as <strong>column gap</strong>, or <strong>row gap</strong>.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dh3oyh1xvw2iy4l/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-26%20at%209.45.40%20AM.png?raw=1" width="100%"></p>
  <h2>Required Video: <em>Grid by Example: Defining a Grid</em></h2>

  <h2>Required Reading: <em>LearnCSSGrid.com</em></h2>

      </div>
      <div class="w7">
        <p>Now that we&#39;ve discussed several different tools and approaches for responsive design, like flexbox, media queries, relative units, and more, let&#39;s begin to explore the differences between these approaches. </p>
<p>In this lesson we&#39;ll observe examples of different responsive design principles in action, in order to see and understand the different effects they create in the browser. This should help us make informed decisions about what responsive principles should be applied to which of our projects, depending on desired outcome. </p>
<h2>Responsive Design Case Studies</h2>
<p>Below are three simple websites. Each has the exact same content, maintains a generally consistent aesthetic, and is responsive. However, we&#39;ve used a different combination of tools and CSS rules in each of to observe their differences.</p>
<h3>Using this Lesson</h3>
<p>Each of the following headers links to the stylesheet used in its example. As you read through each example&#39;s benefits and drawbacks, visit the stylesheet and observe what styles are used, and how the three differ. </p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://github.com/epicodus-lessons/responsive_with_relative_units/blob/master/css/styles.css">Fluid Layout with Relative Units</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jpcxvbxwedkbob8/gif3.gif?raw=1" width="100%"></p>
<p>This example presents responsive content <strong>without media queries or grids</strong>. Instead, we&#39;re <strong>only using relative units</strong> to transform content to fit different viewport sizes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As discussed in the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/responsive-design-preprocessors/relative-units">Relative Units</a> lesson, <code class="prettyprint">padding</code>, <code class="prettyprint">border</code>, and <code class="prettyprint">container</code> values are set with <code class="prettyprint">px</code>, but other values are percentages of either a parent element (using relative percentage <code class="prettyprint">%</code> values) or the viewport (using viewport units <code class="prettyprint">vw</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Notice the <code class="prettyprint">font-size</code> for the entire document is a function of <code class="prettyprint">vw</code>. This makes the text size responsive.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, as in more traditional box model styling, the dimensions of the parent content elements (<code class="prettyprint">.header</code>, <code class="prettyprint">.content-big</code>, and <code class="prettyprint">.content-small</code>) all derive their dimensions from the content itself, instead of being set explicitly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This can be an effective way to style a page with static text that doesn&#39;t change. But much of what makes this layout fluid will <em>also</em> make it difficult to retain its shape.</p>
<p>For example, if content ever changes, or the layout must shift in small ways, writing explicit rules into this stylesheet will cause challenges. What if, for example, we want <code class="prettyprint">.content-big</code> to be a perfect square in all orientations?</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://github.com/epicodus-lessons/responsive_with_media_queries/blob/master/css/styles.css">Multiple Layouts with Media Queries</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3exqva3k7qj8wb/gif4.gif?raw=1" width="100%"></p>
<p>We learned it&#39;s best practice to use relative units like <code class="prettyprint">em</code>, <code class="prettyprint">rem</code>, and <code class="prettyprint">%</code> for text and page content as much as possible. This next stylesheet intentionally breaks that rule to demonstrate what a media query achieves for us. It uses <strong>only media queries, and no relative values.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Notice the different layouts we see between each breakpoint are <em>entirely static</em>. They only &quot;snap&quot; from one layout to the next when breakpoints are applied, and do not gently expand or shrink with the viewport like the previous example.</p></li>
<li><p>The only content that shifts with the window size is the header, because its <code class="prettyprint">display</code> is <code class="prettyprint">block</code> by default, and automatically takes up <code class="prettyprint">100%</code> of its parent width.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s nothing seriously wrong with this approach either. But part of modern web design is creating layouts that work well for text <em>and</em> media content. What would happen if this project included a banner image before the main content?</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://github.com/epicodus-lessons/responsive_with_all_tools/blob/master/css/styles.css">Relative Units, Media Queries, <em>and</em> Flexbox</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uz2of30n320vp5h/gif5.gif?raw=1" width="100%"></p>
<p>This third approach uses <strong>relative units, media queries, <em>and</em> flexbox together</strong>. This allows us to exploit both fluid content and grid systems, giving us the best combination of readable content and fluid transitions between layouts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although this page doesn&#39;t include images, the structure of its stylesheet would be easy to adapt to include fluid images, which we&#39;ll discuss further in the next lesson.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, by using the media queries and grids, it&#39;s easier for us to follow best practices of <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/ui-development-basics/writing-stylesheets-outside-in">&quot;Outside In&quot;</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

      </div>

<h3>Adding Responsiveness to Your LHTP Makeover</h3>
<p>You spent <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/web-design-process/learnhowtoprogram-redesign-three-day-project">three days last week</a> using the Web Design Process to create your own version of this very site, LearnHowToProgram.com. Today, practice responsive design by integrating concepts from this weekend&#39;s homework into last week&#39;s LHTP project.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, review each partner&#39;s project from last week, and determine which you&#39;ll integrate responsiveness into.</p></li>
<li><p>Beginning with your home/landing page, review mobile and desktop wireframes and prototypes. After learning about responsive design, do you have new ideas about how to structure these views? Or does the existing layout already fulfill best practices of responsive design? If necessary, return to the sketches, wireframes and prototypes, and update them to better reflect responsive design.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, craft the necessary HTML, CSS, and Sass to create the coded version of this view. To fully focus on responsive design, <strong>don&#39;t use any styles you wrote last week</strong>. Instead, begin from scratch, focusing on integrating responsiveness and concepts from this weekend&#39;s homework at each step.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat this process for each additional page in your project. You likely won&#39;t have enough time to build every page. That&#39;s 100% okay, and anticipated. Don&#39;t focus on finishing, focus on crafting elegantly-responsive user interfaces.</p></li>
</ul>

      </div>
      <div class="m2">
        <p>Imagine we&#39;re front end developers at a large company that creates and maintains huge apps and websites. Each has hundreds of pages, tons of Sass styles, and countless interfaces to be designed and maintained.</p>
  <p>Now imagine these applications used only the HTML, CSS/Sass and JavaScript techniques we&#39;ve covered so far. Their <em>index.html</em> pages could have hundreds of script tags, each loading a necessary file or tool (like Bootstrap, jQuery, and more). This would be messy. It would also be slow. You see, each of those files takes time to load. Time that adds up quickly. And if a site takes too long to load, many users just leave, losing the company customers and revenue.</p>
  <p>This is a real-life struggle for many companies. In fact, Amazon estimated a single second of lag time would cost them a staggering $1.6 <em>billion</em> in yearly sales. Similarly, Google has determined their traffic drops by 20% if search results take an extra <em>half</em> second to load! In a world where technology responds increasingly fast, users just don&#39;t wait. So it&#39;s up to us, the developers, to ensure speedy load times.</p>
  <p>One common way to decrease load time is to put <em>all</em> code (both code written by developers, and code for outside tools like jQuery or Bootstrap) into a single file. This is called <strong>bundling</strong> or <strong>module bundling</strong>. It&#39;s quicker because the browser only has to load one file. This is faster than loading hundreds of smaller files linked in <code class="prettyprint">&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, even if the single file is pretty hefty.</p>
  <p>Bundling code like this is really common nowadays. So we&#39;re going to practice it too. But we must first set up a <strong>development environment</strong> to handle this process. Let&#39;s learn about them now.</p>
  <h2>Modern JavaScript Development</h2>
  <p>This lesson will discuss three of the most important pieces of a modern development environment: <strong>dependencies</strong>, <strong>package managers</strong>, and <strong>module bundlers</strong>. We&#39;ll learn what they do, why developers use them, and associated vocabulary. Then in the next few lessons we&#39;ll walk through creating our own development environment together.</p>
  <h3>Dependencies</h3>
  <p>Do you remember importing Bootstrap into projects in Intro? Or downloading and linking a jQuery file? These outside tools contained code we didn&#39;t write. But we weren&#39;t plagiarizing! This code is free and available for anyone to use.</p>
  <p>Pieces of outside code we bring into our projects like this are called <strong>dependencies</strong>. There are outside <strong>libraries</strong> (chunks of code designed around a specific purpose that we can bring into a project as a dependency) for almost anything! For instance, a package called <a href="http://momentjs.com/docs/">Moment</a> helps gracefully work with dates and times, libraries like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/documentation">documentation.js</a> help auto-generate documentation for big projects, and dependencies like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/animate.css">Animate.css</a> even create CSS animations. (But don&#39;t worry about these right now, they&#39;re just examples.)</p>
  <p>Cool thing is, <em>anyone</em> can publish a library for others to use as a dependency! Whether a big dev team at a well-known company (like the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react">React library created by Facebook</a>), or a single developer working on a tool at home.</p>
  <h3>Package Managers</h3>
  <p>We practiced locating, downloading, and linking files for Bootstrap and jQuery into our projects in Intro to Programming. But there&#39;s actually a much easier, quicker, and more efficient way to handle this. Something called a <strong>package manager</strong> allows us to download and install dependencies directly through the command line!</p>
  <p>Package managers also automatically create and maintain a file called a <strong>manifest</strong> that lists all installed dependencies. It automatically updates this list as we add or remove dependencies, so we always know what&#39;s installed. The manifest ensures other developers who clone our project download and install the correct dependencies in their copy too.</p>
  <h3>Module Bundler</h3>
  <p>A <strong>module bundler</strong> collects all project source code and concatenates it into a big central file. Using a module bundler has recently become best practice for several reasons:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Decreased load time.</strong> Projects often use many tools. Each must be imported into the project and/or loaded with <code class="prettyprint">&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. The browser loads them individually, which takes time. But combining code from all dependencies into one file (known as a <strong>bundle</strong>) decreases this load time dramatically, because the browser must only load a single file.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Minified code.</strong> Most bundlers also minify code. <strong>Minification</strong> is the process of removing unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments, etc.); things that humans need to easily read code, but computers do not. Removing these characters makes our file smaller. Smaller files load faster. If you&#39;ve ever seen a file (like a Bootstrap stylesheet) with <em>.min</em> in the name you&#39;ve encountered minified code.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now that we have an general understanding of dependencies, package managers, and module bundlers, we&#39;ll begin creating our own development environment in the next lesson, as we walk through installing and using a package manager together.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="m3">
        <p>In the last lesson we discussed the pieces of a modern development environment: Dependencies, module bundlers, and package managers. This lesson will introduce the specific package manager we&#39;ll use, and walk through how to install, configure, and develop with it. Let&#39;s get started!</p>
<h2>Node Package Manager (npm)</h2>
<p>We&#39;ll use the most popular well-supported package manager currently available: Node Package Manager. <strong>Node Package Manager</strong> (usually referred to as <strong>npm</strong>) is a package manager designed to locate, download, and install open-source libraries into projects as dependencies, using only brief command line commands.</p>
<h3>Installing npm</h3>
<p>npm is technically part of software called Node.js. So we must install Node.js to acquire npm. It&#39;s already installed on Epicodus machines. Follow instructions below to install on your personal machine too:</p>
<h4>OSX Installation</h4>
<p>On OS X systems, install <code class="prettyprint">Node.js</code> through <code class="prettyprint">Homebrew</code> with the following command in your home directory:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">$ brew install node
</code></pre>
<p><em>(If you have an older version of <code class="prettyprint">Node</code> already installed, upgrade through <code class="prettyprint">Homebrew</code> by running <code class="prettyprint">$ brew upgrade node</code>.)</em></p>
<p>If you do not have <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> installed on your Mac machine yet, you may install it now by with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-shell">$ /usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Also ensure Homebrew packages are run before the system versions of the same (which may be dated or not what we want) by executing the following:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-shell">$ echo &#39;export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>
<h4>Windows / Linux Installation</h4>
<p>To install Node on other systems, go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node website</a> and download and install the appropriate installer for your operating system.</p>
<h4>Confirm Installation</h4>
<p>Regardless of installation instructions followed, confirm npm is in place by running the <code class="prettyprint">$ npm -v</code> to check its version:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">$ npm -v
5.6.0
</code></pre>
<p>Your version number may not match the one listed here. That&#39;s absolutely alright. Receiving <em>any</em> version number is confirmation the <code class="prettyprint">$ npm</code> command was successfully recognized, and the package manager is therefore installed.</p>
<h3>Initializing npm</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s create a practice project directory to experiment with npm. We&#39;ll call it <em>modern-environment-practice</em>. We can navigate to this new directory in the terminal, then initialize npm in the project with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">$ npm init -y
</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="prettyprint">-y</code> flag tells npm to skip configuration steps required in more complex projects. (We&#39;ll explore this more later.)</p>
<p>After running this command we&#39;ll see a new <em>package.json</em> file has been added to our directory. Let&#39;s open it:</p>
<div class="filename">package.json</div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;modern-environment-practice&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  &quot;keywords&quot;: [],
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This <em>package.json</em> file is our <strong>manifest</strong>. As discussed in the previous lesson, it lists all installed dependencies. Manifests created with npm are always named <em>package.json</em> by default.</p>
<p>So far our manifest only includes standard, default information like the <code class="prettyprint">name</code> and <code class="prettyprint">version</code> of our project. No outside packages yet.</p>
<h3>Installing a Dependency with npm</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s change that! We&#39;ll use npm to install our first dependency. Remember Bootstrap? We used to have to visit the Bootstrap website, find either the CDN link tag to copy/paste, or download its stylesheet, then manually insert it in our projects.</p>
<p>But not with a package manager! Check it out, we can run the following command in our project directory:</p>
<pre>$ npm install bootstrap
</pre>
<p>We&#39;ll see a text response in our terminal, then three things will happen:</p>
<ol>
<li> Our <em>package.json</em> manifest file will be updated.</li>
<li> A new <em>node_modules</em> directory will appear in our project.</li>
<li> Depending on our version of npm, a <em>package-lock.json</em> file will appear in our directory too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s look at each in detail.</p>
<h4>1. Manifest Update</h4>
<p>First off, open <em>package.json</em> again:</p>
<div class="filename">package.json</div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;modern-environment-practice&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  &quot;keywords&quot;: [],
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;,
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;bootstrap&quot;: &quot;^4.1.3&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the new section at the bottom labeled <code class="prettyprint">dependencies</code>? That&#39;s a list of all dependencies npm has installed into our project. And look, it now includes Bootstrap. It even lists the exact version installed! Just like that, Bootstrap is now installed in our project.</p>
<h4>2. Creation of <em>node_modules</em> Directory</h4>
<p>Next let&#39;s check out the new <em>node_modules</em> directory. We can see it contains a ton of files:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a <em>bootstrap</em> subdirectory within <em>node_modules</em>. It contains multiple subdirectories, full of <code class="prettyprint">.js</code>, <code class="prettyprint">.css</code> and <code class="prettyprint">.scss</code> files. <strong>This is all the code required for Bootstrap!</strong> It even includes Sass-compatible versions! And we didn&#39;t have to visit the Bootstrap website, locate the correct stylesheet, download it, and place it in our directory manually. We just ran a single command, and npm handled the rest!</p>
<h4>3. <em>package-lock.json</em> File</h4>
<p>Versions of npm above 5.0 will also generate a <em>package-lock.json</em> file. (If your machine doesn&#39;t generate one, don&#39;t worry, versions below 5.0 still work perfectly fine with our curriculum.)</p>
<p>This file helps avoid dependency versioning issues by &quot;locking down&quot; versions. <strong>Don&#39;t touch this file</strong>. npm is programmed to automatically maintain it for us. Just leave it as-is, and we&#39;ll discuss it in greater detail later. (But if you&#39;re <em>really set</em> on learning more now, we recommend James Quigley&#39;s blog post <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-package-lock-json-b81911aa8ab8"><em>Everything You Wanted to Know About package-lock.json But Were Too Afraid to Ask</em></a>).</p>
<h3>More Dependency Installation Practice</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s practice this npm installation process again. We&#39;ll install another library used frequently in Intro, jQuery, by running the following command in our directory:</p>
<pre>$ npm install jquery
</pre>
<p>Again we&#39;ll see text appear in our terminal, and our <em>package.json</em> file will be updated to include this new dependency:</p>
<div class="filename">package.json</div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;modern-environment-practice&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  &quot;keywords&quot;: [],
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;,
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;bootstrap&quot;: &quot;^4.1.3&quot;,
    &quot;jquery&quot;: &quot;^3.3.1&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <em>node_modules</em> directory now contains a <em>jquery</em> subdirectory too. Just like that, we&#39;ve installed another outside codebase into our project as a dependency!</p>
<p>This is pretty cool right? Not to mention a <em>huge</em> timesaver. In the next few lessons we&#39;ll continue working with npm, including using it to install our module bundler Webpack.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="m4">
        <p>The npm package manager we just learned about is pretty cool, right? Not only can we install dependencies in mere seconds, but the <em>package.json</em> manifest keeps track of exactly which we&#39;ve added.</p>
    <p>It can also do something else that&#39;s pretty dang cool. Check it out:</p>
    <h2>Installing Multiple Dependencies</h2>
    <p>In Atom, right-click our project&#39;s <em>node_modules</em> directory and hit <em>Delete</em>. Confirm <em>node_modules</em> is removed from the project entirely.</p>
    <p>Is it gone? Good. Next, run the following in the project directory:</p>
    <pre>$ npm install
    </pre>
    <p>After that, we&#39;ll revisit our project in Atom. Look at that! <em>node_modules</em> is back in there, even though we deleted it! It even contains both the <em>bootstrap</em> and <em>jquery</em> subdirectories from before.</p>
    <p>That <code class="prettyprint">$ npm install</code> command prompts npm to download and install the specific versions of <strong>all</strong> dependencies listed in the <em>project.json</em> manifest. And this ability to install everything with a single command is actually <em>so</em> quick and painless that it allows us to omit dependencies from repos entirely.</p>
    <h2>Omitting Dependency Code</h2>
    <p>In fact, it&#39;s considered best practice <em>not</em> to commit outside dependency code (that is, anything in the <em>node_modules</em> directory) to Git and GitHub repos. This ensures repos contain only (or at least mostly) our own code, and keeps them clean, organized, and easy to navigate.</p>
    <p>When other developers (or ourselves in the future) want to retrieve and run the project they can clone down the repo and simply run <code class="prettyprint">$ npm install</code> to snag all dependencies.</p>
    <p>This means we must make sure our <em>package.json</em> manifest is always committed, and our <em>node_modules</em> directory is always ignored. We can handle this with a simple <em>.gitignore</em> file.</p>
    <h3><code class="prettyprint">.gitignore</code> Review</h3>
    <p>Back in Intro the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/git-configurations"><em>Git Configurations</em></a> lesson showed us how to omit certain files from all repos on a global level. But we can also add <em>.gitignore</em> files to individual projects.</p>
    <p>We&#39;ll create our own <em>.gitignore</em> in the top-level of our practice project now, and add the following:</p>
    <div class="filename">.gitignore</div>
    <pre><code class="prettyprint">node_modules/
    .DS_Store
    </code></pre>
    <p>A few things to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><em>.gitignore</em> files always reside in the top-level of a project directory.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <code class="prettyprint">.DS_Store</code> we listed inside our <em>.gitignore</em>, seen above, is an unnecessary Mac-specific file that doesn&#39;t need to be committed.</p></li>
    <li><p><code class="prettyprint">node-modules/</code> refers to the directory containing source code for dependencies installed with npm.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <em>.gitignore</em> file <strong>must be added and committed before we commit <em>node_modules</em></strong>. (But accidentally committing <em>node_modules</em> before <em>.gitignore</em> is a common mistake. There&#39;s an easy solution explained below.)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common <code class="prettyprint">.gitignore</code> Mistake</h3>
    <p>If you Git is tracking a file that should actually be ignored, make sure to add that file to <em>.gitignore</em>. Then run <code class="prettyprint">$ git rm --cached [FILE-OR-DIRECTORY-NAME]</code>, where <code class="prettyprint">[FILE-OR-DIRECTORY-NAME]</code> is the name of the file or directory that shouldn&#39;t be tracked.</p>
    <p>So if we ever accidentally commit <em>node_modules</em> before adding and committing our <em>.gitignore</em> file specifying to ignore this directory, we can run <code class="prettyprint">$ git rm --cached node_modules</code> to retroactively remove it from the repo, and begin ignoring it instead.</p>
    <p>From now on, your projects should always include a <em>.gitignore</em> file with <em>node_modules</em> listed.</p>
    <h2>Uninstalling Dependencies with npm</h2>
    <p>Continuing with our practice project, we won&#39;t actually use Bootstrap or jQuery this week. We just used these familiar dependencies to practice npm.</p>
    <p>Let&#39;s uninstall them from our project now. Npm has another easy command for that too:</p>
    <pre>$ npm uninstall bootstrap
    $ npm uninstall jquery
    </pre>
    <p>Just like that, we should see the packages disappear from our <em>node_modules</em> directory and <em>package.json</em> manifest.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="m5">
        <p>We&#39;ve learned that modern development environments include dependencies, a package manager, and a module bundler. In the last few lessons we discussed package managers and dependencies, and practiced using them in a sample project.</p>
<p>Next let&#39;s explore module bundlers. Specifically Webpack, the industry bundler of choice.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Webpack</h2>
<p>As you&#39;ll recall from a few lessons ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>module bundler</strong> collects all project source code and concatenates it into a big central file. Using a module bundler has recently become best practice for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Decreased load time.</strong> Projects often use many tools. Each must be imported into the project and/or loaded with <code class="prettyprint">&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. The browser loads them individually, which takes time. But combining code from all dependencies into one file (known as a <strong>bundle</strong>) decreases this load time dramatically, because the browser must only load a single file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minified code.</strong> Most bundlers also minify code. <strong>Minification</strong> is the process of removing unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments, etc.); things that humans need to easily read code, but computers do not. Removing these characters makes our file smaller. Smaller files load faster. If you&#39;ve ever seen a file (like a Bootstrap stylesheet) with <em>.min</em> in the name you&#39;ve encountered minified code.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ll use <strong>Webpack</strong> as our module bundler. In addition to general benefits listed above, Webpack offers a few of its own helpful features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Flexible Configurations</strong>: Webpack supports things called <strong>plugins</strong> and <strong>loaders</strong> that configure it to work with almost any other technology or language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Development Server</strong>: It also offers a development server that can be configured to re-bundle code every time it changes, and serve it up in the browser to view. (We&#39;ll work on this in an upcoming lesson.)</p></li>

<h3>Installing Webpack</h3>
<p>We&#39;ll use npm to install Webpack into the practice project we&#39;ve been working with. Run the following command in your project directory. (It&#39;s different than commands from previous lessons. We&#39;ll discuss why in a moment.)</p>
<pre>$ npm install <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="453220273524262e05716b756b74">[email&#160;protected]</a> --save-dev
</pre>
<p>There are two new parts to this command:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <code class="prettyprint">@4.0.1</code> appended to the end of the package name. This is a specific package or dependency version.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="prettyprint">--save-dev</code> bit added to the very end. This specifies that Webpack is a development dependencies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s discuss each of these new additions:</p>
<h4>1. Package Versions</h4>
<p>Whenever we want npm to install a specific version of a dependency we add the version number to the installation command. So by stating <code class="prettyprint">$ npm install <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8ef9ebecfeefede5cebaa0bea0bf">[email&#160;protected]</a></code> we&#39;re instructing npm to specifically download and install Webpack version 4.0.1.</p>
<p>If a version number is not specified (as seen in the previous lesson in commands like <code class="prettyprint">$ npm install bootstrap</code>) npm defaults to the latest stable version.</p>
<p><strong>When following Epicodus curriculum, always use the <em>exact</em> installation commands provided in lessons, including exact version numbers</strong>. Not all packages play nicely with every version of all other packages. And you don&#39;t want to detangle complex incompatible package version issues while trying to practice basics, or learn new tools.</p>
<p>Carefully curating versions like this isn&#39;t specific to Epicodus. It&#39;s part of professional web development. Again, not every dependency works perfectly with every other dependency. So when we find the perfect combination, we keep those exact versions in our <em>package.json</em> manifest. This is called <strong>version pinning</strong>. Development teams then continue using those pinned versions until they <em>absolutely need</em> a feature a newer version offers, until the pinned version is retired, or until the pinned version no longer functions correctly with new code added to the project.</p>
<p>On a big professional project, upgrading dependency versions is really tricky! It&#39;s an all-hands-on-deck project the entire development team sets time aside time for. It requires tons of testing and research. Bringing in a new version also increases the chance for bugs. As such, <strong>professional development teams don&#39;t upgrade dependencies just because newer versions were released</strong>. Have you ever heard the classic saying <em>&quot;If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot;</em>? It&#39;s best practice to follow this same adage when dealing with versioning too.</p>
<p>This in mind, it&#39;s common to see even the most well-maintained codebases using dependencies multiple versions behind the latest releases. <strong>This is normal.</strong> Always use the exact versions depicted in our curriculum, even if it&#39;s not the absolute <em>most</em> recent version.</p>
<p>Essentially: Newer does not mean better. Older does not mean outdated. And if it isn&#39;t broken, developers don&#39;t risk bugs and outages to update to latest versions just because they&#39;re newer. So you shouldn&#39;t either.</p>
<h4>2. Development Dependencies</h4>
<p>Moving on, that <code class="prettyprint">--save-dev</code> bit on the end of the <code class="prettyprint">$ npm install <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="592e3c3b29383a32196d77697768">[email&#160;protected]</a> --save-dev</code> command above is new too.</p>
<p>Open up the practice project&#39;s <em>package.json</em> manifest file and take another peek:</p>
<div class="filename">package.json</div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;modern-environment-practice&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  &quot;keywords&quot;: [],
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;,
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {},
  &quot;devDependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;webpack&quot;: &quot;^4.0.1&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice there&#39;s a new section called <code class="prettyprint">devDependencies</code>. This stands for <strong>development dependencies</strong>, which refers to dependencies only used while the project is in development. This is different than &quot;normal&quot; dependencies (in the <code class="prettyprint">dependencies</code> section of <em>package.json</em>) that will be used both while the project is in development, and when the final, published product is run by users in their browsers.</p>
<p>Remember jQuery? When sites we developed in Intro used jQuery they required that functionality in both production and development versions. If we were using a jQuery method to add a hover effect to a button, for instance, that jQuery method had to be available both when we&#39;re developing (so we, the developers, can test it out) and <em>also</em> in the final published version (so the users see that nifty hover effect too.) This is an example of a &quot;normal&quot; dependency.</p>
<p>But Webpack is a module bundler. It smushes code into a central bundle file. Once that code is published online, Webpack doesn&#39;t need to do anything to our code until the next time we, the <em>developers</em>, update and re-publish it. It will only ever be used during development, so it&#39;s considered a development dependency.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry if the difference between dependency types isn&#39;t immediately clear. We&#39;ll continue to denote which dependencies to install as which type. You&#39;ll have the rest of the program to solidify this knowledge.</p>
<h3>Webpack CLI</h3>
<p>Moving on, Webpack is now added to our project as a development dependency. When we use Webpack we&#39;ll run a command in our terminal to tell it to bundle up our code. (Similar to how we run a command to compile Sass.)</p>
<p>To use Webpack in the terminal we need another package called Webpack CLI. This package grants us the ability to call Webpack from the command line (CLI stands for &quot;command line interface&quot;). We can install it now:</p>
<pre>$ npm install <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b3c4d6d1c3d2d0d89ed0dfdaf3819d839d8a">[email&#160;protected]</a> --save-dev
</pre>
<p>With this installed, we can now run the following in our project directory:</p>
<pre>$ webpack
</pre>
<p>This tells Webpack to bundle our project&#39;s code. But hey! We actually get an error:</p>
<pre>Hash: 86cb31cfb7da0752b199
Version: webpack 4.0.1
Time: 67ms
Built at: <DATE> <TIME>

WARNING in configuration
The 'mode' option has not been set. Set 'mode' option to 'development' or 'production' to enable defaults for this environment.

ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in '/Users/epicodus_student/Desktop/modern-environment-practice'
</pre>
<p>Here we have both a warning message, and an error message.</p>
<p>The warning states we need to tell Webpack whether this is a production or development environment. We do that by adding a flag to our command, like this:</p>
<pre>$ webpack --mode development
</pre>
<p>We&#39;ll add this flag to all commands instructing Webpack to bundle code. </p>
<p>The warning says it cannot find a <em>./src</em> directory in our project. By default, Webpack 4.0+ looks for an <strong>entry point file</strong> at <em>src/index.js</em>, as this is common convention.</p>
<p>An <strong>entry point</strong> is the file that instructs the module bundler how to build and bundle the application. It&#39;s a bit like an instruction manual. Let&#39;s construct one in our practice project now!</p>
<h3>Entry Point File</h3>
<p>We&#39;ll create an <em>src</em> directory at the top level of our project. <em>src</em> stands for &quot;source&quot;, or &quot;source code&quot;. <strong>Source code</strong> is the custom code <em>we</em> write--not code imported from dependencies, or code in the bundle file Webpack produces. This means <strong>all code we write resides in <em>src</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Within our new <em>src</em> directory, we&#39;ll add an <em>index.js</em> file. For now we&#39;ll just throw a basic <code class="prettyprint">console.log()</code> in it:</p>
<div class="filename">src/index.js</div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-javascript">console.log(&quot;hey!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Now let&#39;s run Webpack again with the appropriate command:</p>
<pre>$ webpack --mode development
</pre>
<p>And we should see something like this appear in the console:</p>
<pre>Hash: 6591330ed601b5a8a96b
Version: webpack 4.0.1
Time: 82ms
Built at: <DATE> <TIME>
  Asset      Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
main.js  2.84 KiB    main  [emitted]  main
Entrypoint main = main.js
[./src/index.js] 27 bytes {main} [built]
</pre>
<p>This means Webpack has successfully bundled our code! Check out our project directory:</p>
<pre>modern-environment-practice
├── dist
│   └── main.js
├── node_modules
│   └── ((content omitted for brevity))
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src
│   └── index.js
├── webpack.config.js
└── .gitignore
</pre>
<p>That <em>dist</em> directory is new! It contains a single file, <em>main.js</em> which is the code Webpack has bundled up for us! &quot;dist&quot; stands for distribution, and is common naming convention for directories containing bundled code, because this code will be <em>distributed</em> to the browser.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important that <strong>we never, ever edit code in <em>dist</em> directly.</strong> This code is only ever altered by Webpack, <em>not</em> us. We edit our project&#39;s code in the <em>src</em> directory, then rely upon Webpack to turn our code from <em>src</em> into the bundle distributed in the browser in <em>dist</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Never edit <em>dist</em>. Only edit <em>src</em>.</strong></p>
<h2>Ignore <em>Dist</em></h2>
<p>Remember how we added our <em>node_modules</em> directory to our <em>.gitignore</em> file in the last lesson to omit it from repos? We did this because other developers can simply run <code class="prettyprint">$ npm install</code> to download all dependency code in <em>node_modules</em>, so we don&#39;t need to save them in our repo.</p>
<p>Well, we don&#39;t need to include this <em>dist</em> directory in our repo either, for a very similar reason. Other developers (or ourselves in the future) can simply run <code class="prettyprint">$ webpack --mode development</code> to bundle code into the <em>main.js</em> file in <em>dist</em>. So we don&#39;t need to save it in our repository. We&#39;ll add this directory to our <em>.gitignore</em> file now:</p>
<div class="filename">.gitignore</div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">node_modules/
.DS_Store
dist/
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Make sure to do this in all future projects that use Webpack, too!</strong>. And remember, if we ever accidentally commit <em>dist</em> to our repo before adding and committing a <em>.gitignore</em> file ignoring this directory, we can run <code class="prettyprint">$ git rm --cached dist</code> to retroactively remove it from the repo, and begin ignoring it instead.</p>
<p>Great! We now know how to install Webpack in our projects, the commands to run to instruct it to bundle up our code, and best practice for ignoring those bundles. In the next few lessons we&#39;ll further discuss best practices for creating modern web development environments with module bundlers, dependencies, and package managers. Stay tuned!</p>

      </div>
      <div class="m6">
        <p>In the last lesson we attempted to run the <code class="prettyprint">$ webpack</code> command in our project directory, but received a warning telling us the command must specify whether the project is in development, or production mode. So we added this info to our command, like this...</p>
  <pre><code class="prettyprint">$ webpack --mode development
  </code></pre>
  <p>...And it worked without error!</p>
  <p>Additional information added to a command, preceded by hyphens like this, are called <strong>flags</strong>.</p>
  <h2>npm Scripts</h2>
  <p>Remembering to add the <code class="prettyprint">--mode development</code> flag to our Webpack command isn&#39;t <em>too</em> inconvenient. But we can actually make this process easier.</p>
  <p>Notice this section in <em>package.json</em>?</p>
  <div class="filename">package.json</div>
  <pre><code class="prettyprint lang-json">...
    &quot;scripts&quot;: {
      &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
    }
  ...
  </code></pre>
  <p><code class="prettyprint">scripts</code> refers to code that runs in the terminal to complete a task. And <code class="prettyprint">test</code> is a <em>type</em> of script that came with this file by default.</p>
  <h3>Running npm Scripts</h3>
  <p>We run <code class="prettyprint">scripts</code> included in <em>package.json</em> by preceding them with <code class="prettyprint">npm run</code> in the command line. So we can test out this <code class="prettyprint">test</code> script by running the following in the project directory:</p>
  <pre><code class="prettyprint">$ npm run test
  </code></pre>
  <p>It returns this:</p>
  <pre>echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1

  Error: no test specified
  npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
  </pre>
  <p>Notice this matches text from <em>package.json</em>:</p>
  <div class="filename">package.json</div>
  <pre><code class="prettyprint lang-json">...
    &quot;scripts&quot;: {
      &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
    }
  ...
  </code></pre>
  <p>So. We ran the <code class="prettyprint">$ npm run test</code> script, and npm spat the content associated with <code class="prettyprint">test</code> in <em>package.json</em> into the terminal. Following this same pattern, we can actually define scripts that insert <em>whatever we want</em> into terminal; including other commands!</p>
  <h3>Writing npm Scripts</h3>
  <p>We&#39;ll add the following to <em>package.json</em>:</p>
  <div class="filename">package.json</div>
  <pre><code class="prettyprint lang-json">...
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;webpack --mode development&quot;,
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  ...
  </code></pre>
  <p>Now if we run <code class="prettyprint">$ npm run build</code>, we should see Webpack runs the <code class="prettyprint">$ webpack --mode development</code> for us!</p>
  <p>It might not feel efficient to just map one command to another command like this, but it&#39;s actually best practice! You see, <code class="prettyprint">build</code> is standard naming convention for scripts that compile or bundle a project. So by mapping <em>whatever</em> our bundling command is to this standardized <code class="prettyprint">$ npm run build</code>, <em>any</em> developer can use the same industry standard to launch our project. And we don&#39;t have to remember that <code class="prettyprint">--mode development</code> flag either!</p>
  <p><strong>Remember to map your Webpack bundling command to the npm <code class="prettyprint">build</code> command in all future projects.</strong> We&#39;ll explore other helpful npm scripts in future lessons too!</p>

        Adding Responsiveness to Your LHTP Makeover
        You spent three days last week using the Web Design Process to create your own version of this very site, LearnHowToProgram.com. Today, practice responsive design by integrating concepts from this weekend's homework into last week's LHTP project.

        First, review each partner's project from last week, and determine which you'll integrate responsiveness into.

        Beginning with your home/landing page, review mobile and desktop wireframes and prototypes. After learning about responsive design, do you have new ideas about how to structure these views? Or does the existing layout already fulfill best practices of responsive design? If necessary, return to the sketches, wireframes and prototypes, and update them to better reflect responsive design.

        Next, craft the necessary HTML, CSS, and Sass to create the coded version of this view. To fully focus on responsive design, don't use any styles you wrote last week. Instead, begin from scratch, focusing on integrating responsiveness and concepts from this weekend's homework at each step.

        Repeat this process for each additional page in your project. You likely won't have enough time to build every page. That's 100% okay, and anticipated. Don't focus on finishing, focus on crafting elegantly-responsive user interfaces.

        Peer Code Review
        Design is responsive, and dynamically resizes into a mobile-friendly layout.
        Best practices of responsive design are followed, including using relative units, designing mobile layouts first, integrating media queries to dynamically reorganize and resize content, and integrating images fluidly.
        Styles are written in Sass syntax, and well-refactored using Sass functionality.
