      <div class="weekend-1">
        This week will focus on two important concepts front end developers use constantly: Responsive Design and a tool called Webpack. Before we begin, we want to give you a run-down of each (including some important notes on course structure):

Responsive Design
One of the most important concepts introduced last week was mobile-first design. This is because more and more users access the web on mobile devices. One source, Statista, states:

As of February 2017, mobile devices excluding tablets accounted for 49.73 percent of web page views worldwide. Asia and Africa had a higher than average mobile traffic share with 65.1 percent and 59.49 percent of mobile traffic respectively.

And this number is only projected to increase:

In 2020, the number of smartphone users worldwide is projected to reach 2.87 billion, up from 2.1 billion in 2016.

Because half or more of users view sites on smartphones, it's more important than ever that interfaces gracefully reconfigure themselves to fit all screen sizes.

We've already practiced media queries that do this. This week we'll explore more advanced features that allow applications to dynamically alter style and structure based on screen size. This study is called responsive design. We'll discuss things like writing code that elegantly rearranges and resizes content, special responsive considerations for images, writing responsive Sass, best practices for responsive designs, cutting-edge responsive CSS3 features, and more.

Development Environments
The second big concept we'll explore is Webpack. Webpack is a module bundler. This is a tool that collects all source code for a project, and concatenates it into one central file. This both dramatically decreases load time in the browser, and maintains an organized development environment. For these reasons, Webpack has exploded in popularity since its 2015 introduction and is now considered an industry standard for creating development environments.

Because this tool is so prevalent, we thoroughly practice it in the JavaScript course all students take. However, Webpack is in especially high demand in front end development. We've found that many (if not most) local front end job postings mention it. As such, it's important your portfolio contain examples of integrating Webpack with the front end-focused concepts of this course.

But we felt it unfair to require front end studnets complete extra work in the JavaScript course, where Weback is usually introduced, to create these work examples. This would require extra hours spend on each JavaScript project, subtracting from the already-limited time to practice the complex concepts introduced in that course.

Here's what we'll do instead: You'll receive early exposure to Webpack this week, beginning Monday evening, to craft portfolio projects that demonstrate high-demand front end skills. The trade-off? A few concepts in your first week of JavaScript will be review. Slightly more homework this week, in exchange for more review-oriented homework in three weeks, and a portfolio that will better match demands of the job market.

Independent Project Objectives
As always, we'll complete an independent project on Friday. This week's project will be evaluated on the following:

Development environment is fully-functional, including Webpack module bundling, and a development server.
Design is responsive, and dynamically resizes into a mobile-friendly layout.
Best practices of responsive design are followed, including using relative units, designing mobile layouts first, integrating media queries to dynamically reorganize and resize content, and integrating images fluidly.
Styles are written in Sass syntax, and well-refactored using Sass functionality.
Project is in a professional, portfolio-quality state.
Project was submitted by the Friday deadline.
Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your project with an instructor using the correct terminology.

      <div class="weekend-2">
        According to Statista, mobile internet traffic made up 52.64% of online traffic in 2017. They also report that over 3.8 billion people regularly used mobile devices to access the internet in 2018. Based on these numbers alone, it's overwhelmingly clear web users will continue viewing content on a variety of screen sizes. This means websites must ensure their content is presentable and functional on all possible viewport sizes.

        This lesson will begin exploring how developers tackle this challenge, as we discuss responsive web design, what it means, and even observe example firsthand. Then in the next few lessons we'll review how to use things like relative units, media queries, and fluid images to begin making our own sites responsive to any screen size.

        Responsive Web Design
        Around 2009, people began using words like fluid, elastic, and liquid to describe web layouts. Later in 2010 Ethan Marcotte officially coined the term responsive web design in his article Responsive Web Design. He stated:

        Recently, an emergent discipline called “responsive architecture” has begun asking how physical spaces can respond to the presence of people passing through them...In their book Interactive Architecture, Michael Fox and Miles Kemp described this more adaptive approach as “a multiple-loop system in which one enters into a conversation; a continual and constructive information exchange.” I think that’s a subtle yet powerful distinction: rather than creating immutable, unchanging spaces that define a particular experience, they suggest inhabitant and structure can—and should—mutually influence each other.

        This is our way forward. Rather than tailoring disconnected designs to each of an ever-increasing number of web devices, we can treat them as facets of the same experience. We can design for an optimal viewing experience, but embed standards-based technologies into our designs to make them not only more flexible, but more adaptive to the media that renders them. In short, we need to practice responsive web design. But how?

        While Marcotte's original statement is dense, even challenging to understand upon first reading, know that its core idea is simple: User interfaces should flexibly adapt based on screen size, to offer users similar experiences regardless of their device.

        In his subsequent book, also titled Responsive Web Design, Marcotte explains how developers achieve this:

        So what does it take to create a responsive design? Speaking purely in terms of front-end layout, it takes three core ingredients:

        A flexible, grid-based layout
        Flexible images and media
        Media queries, a module from the CSS3 specification
        Responsive Web Design In Action
        Since then, every major site has become responsive. Check out the following examples of what this looks like in action:

        Required Video: Responsive Web Design Example

        Required Video: Responsive Web Design Example: Smashing Magazine

        More Live Examples
        Before moving on, try out some responsive designs for yourself too! Visit a few of the following links and manually adjust your browser window width to observe how their layouts change:

        NPR.org
        Black Sheep Studios
        Huru Backpacks
        Different Motorcycles
        Notre Dame University
        Easy UX
        The Awwwards section for responsive design contains many award-winning examples.
        And this certainly isn't limited to the sites above. Visit nearly any major site online and you'll see that resizing your viewport results in reorganization of content.

        In the next lessons we'll begin reviewing the underlying principles of responsive design, before crafting our own responsive interfaces together.

      <div class="weekend-3">
        In the Value Units prework lesson we discussed the term relative units, explaining:

Relative units...are relative to things like the parent container, an element's font size, or the size of the browser window. (For instance, if we specify an image should be 50% the width of its parent container, it will differ in size depending on the size of that parent!)

We learned that em, rem, vw, and % (percentage) values are relative because they flexibly change in relation to other elements (usually their parent). For example, if we declare a div should be 50% as wide as its parent, it doesn't matter if that parent is 1000px wide on a desktop, or 200px on a smartphone; the child div will always be half as wide.

This dynamic flexibility makes relative units a crucial part of responsive design, because they automatically ensure elements maintain a size in consistent proportion with other elements, regardless of viewport size. This save us from writing tons of media queries to resize each individual item. In this lesson we'll discuss how to best use relative units to create responsive layouts.

(If the concept relative units feels unfamiliar, review the Value Units lesson before continuing.)

Relative Units
Many relative units used in responsive design (besides viewport units) actually originate from the very first version of CSS! But their use in responsive design is considerably more far-reaching. As usage of relative units grows increasingly broad, best practices become more involved.

Here are the most important best practices for relative CSS units in responsive design:

Use px Units for Constant Sizing
Always use px units for elements that should stay the same dimensions regardless of viewport size. That is, if we don't want an item to resize with the viewport.

Elements we want to stay consistent, regardless of viewport size, include things like the width of a document's first parent container (often denoted with the class container), borders and padding, or the width of a line break.

The CSS below, for instance, follows this rule:

html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-size: 100%;
}

*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  border-left: 2px solid lightSeaGreen;
  border-right: 2px solid lightSeaGreen;
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 1400px;
  padding: 15px;
}

.main-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.content-box {
  width: 48%;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
px creates rigid content values, like the max-width and padding of the parent .container. The maximum is just that...the maximum, we don't want this upper limit to change in size.

Styles for children of this parent .container use relative values; primarily percentages. This ensures their size maintains a consistent, proportional relationship with the parent's size.

Avoid px in Child Elements
In child elements, use em, rem, percentages, or viewport units (vw) whenever possible.

Using absolute units like px on child elements can lead to pretty random numbers. These are called floating or magic numbers because they're difficult to understand almost immediately after they're written. As the Magic Numbers in CSS article by Chris Coyier describes:

Despite the super fun sounding name, magic numbers are a bad thing...[they are] just some number plunked into the code that is probably vital to things working correctly but are very difficult for anyone not intimately familiar with the code to understand...

Here's an example of CSS that uses way too many hard-coded px values:

.container {
  border-left: 2px solid lightSeaGreen;
  border-right: 2px solid lightSeaGreen;
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 1400px;
  min-height: 10000px;
  padding: 15px;
  width: 1200px;
}

.main-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 800px;
  width: inherit;
}

.content-box {
  width: 48%;
  height: 532px;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
Notice how difficult it is to understand why these values are necessary? Or to visualize what this page might look like based on its CSS?

And if we later decide the height of .main-content or .content-box should dynamically shrink to fit smaller screens, we'd have to go write media queries to reset that hardcoded pixel value. This is much less efficient than using a relative value that would automatically handle maintaining a proportional size on smaller screens for us.

Double-Check Support for vw Viewport Units
When building a layout that must be supported by many browsers, especially older ones, double-check known bugs for vw viewport units.

We recommend using viewport units because they helpfully allow access to viewport dimensions from nested children. For this reason they are quickly becoming standard, especially in Chrome.

That said, if we're building a layout that must be supported by many browsers, we should view the Known Issues section for Viewport Units on CanIUse.com to see what bugs we may need to anticipate.

Set Document Font Size with Percentages
Explicitly set font-sizes using percentages, even if you're using the browser's default 16px font size:

html {
  font-size: 100%;
}
This may seem redundant, but it communicates to other developers that we're intentional maintaining the browser's default 16px font size, making it easier for them to quickly understand our layout after glancing at our styles.

We could also set our document font-size like this:

html {
  font-size: calc(125% + 2vw);
}
Here we use the CSS calc() function to allow font-size to grow and shrink with the window's width, as communicated with vw viewport units.

Only Modify font-size from the Lowest Parent
In other words, avoid changing font-size in a manner that requires cascading.

Consider the following example from Chris Basham's gist on CSS best practices. It depicts the correct way to alter font sizes parent and child elements:

.parent {
}

.child-heading {
  font-size: 1.2em;
}

.child-body {
  font-size: 0.9em;
}
We change font size in children using ems, a unit relative to the font-size of the parent.

The parent .parent retains the document's default font-size of 16px, because we do not set it to anything else.

In the first child, we modify the font-size to be 1.2em (that is, 1.2 times the parent's font-size of 16px). The resulting font size in .child-heading is therefore 19.2px.

The second child, .child-body is assigned a font size equal to .9em of the parent, meaning its text will be 17.28px in size.

Example of What We Should Not Do
Here's an example of the incorrect way to resize fonts that we should absolutely not use:

.parent {
  font-size: 1.2em;
}

.child-heading {
  font-size: 1em;
}

.child-body {
  font-size: 0.75em;
}
This is problematic. This changes relative text values for elements that do not actually contain text!

This means em values in the nested children are relative to a parent that has nothing to do with text in .child-heading and .child-body. Not only is this confusing for other developers, but it can easily lead to bugs down the road.

Use rem for Padding and Margin in Grids and Lists
Use rem instead of em for padding and margin in grids and lists.

Remember the difference between rem and em? rem is the successor of em. In the same way viewport units provide access to viewport size from any child, rem gives access to the default px settings of the root element to any child. In our case that's the HTML tag of the DOM.

As a result, using rem instead of em can ensure values act consistently throughout the entire document.

Example of What We Should Not Do
Here's an example of not following this best practice:

html {
  font-size: 100%;
}

.main-grid-parent {
  font-size: 2em;
  padding: 2em;
  margin: 2em;
}

.main-grid-child {
  padding: 2em;
  margin: 2em;
}

.secondary-grid-parent {
  font-size: 2em;
}

.secondary-grid-child {
  padding: 2em;
  margin: 2em;
}
Here the grid children have equivalent rules, but will be given very different padding and margin values because the em's are relative to their parents. This means .main-grid-child will have gutters twice the size of .secondary-grid-child. Not good!

Example of What We Should Do
Check out this easy solution depicting what we should do instead:

html {
  font-size: 100%;
}

.main-grid-parent {
  font-size: 2em;
  padding: 2em;
  margin: 2em;
}

.main-grid-child {
  padding: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem;
}

.secondary-grid-parent {
  font-size: 2em;
}

.secondary-grid-child {
  padding: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem;
}
Way better!

Aim to use relative units this week as we explore responsive design. Refer back to this lesson during development to ensure you're following best practices to produce clean, professional CSS. Pretty soon, they'll become second nature.

        In the Introduction to Responsive Design lesson, we learned that responsive design is composed of three primary ingredients, as described by Ethan Marcotte:

        A flexible, grid-based layout
        Flexible images and media
        Media queries, a module from the CSS3 specification
        This lesson will dive deeper into the third item on this list, media queries, and how to best utilize them in responsive design. The next lesson will discuss flexible grids, then we'll learn about flexible images in Tuesday's homework.

        Media Queries
        As discussed earlier in the course, a media query is a block of CSS applied only when specific conditions about the user's viewport are true. This allows us to change layout structure and style based on viewport width. The point at which a condition becomes true, and the query's CSS is applied, is called the breakpoint.

        Determining Breakpoints
        Over time, phones, tablets and other devices have created widely-recognized pixel ranges often used in media queries. For example, as outlined here, most tablets are between 600 and 900 pixels in portrait orientation. So you may assume that breakpoints should correspond exactly with these common device sizes.

        But that's actually a dangerously incorrect assumption! Determining where breakpoints should lie differs greatly between applications, and requires more careful thought and planning than referring to common screen sizes. Let's discuss best practices for effective breakpoints in responsive designs.

        Required Reading: The 100% Correct Way to do CSS Breakpoints
        First off, read David Gilbertson's tips for constructing breakpoints in his article, The 100% Correct Way to do CSS Breakpoints.

        Breakpoint Best Practices
        As Gilbertson explains, configuring breakpoints is really tricky. Fortunately, there are rules we can follow to help:

        Content First
        Breakpoints should be determined based on the specific application's content, not an outside standard like common smartphone sizes. The breakpoints in Gilbertson's the article are a great guideline, but your breakpoints for your applications should be determined based on the needs of your unique content.

        For example, if there's a high-resolution image we want featured prominently on a page, but a 'standard-issue' breakpoint cuts it off or sizes it in an unflattering manner, that's a big indication we should make the breakpoint work for the content, instead of forcing the content into the breakpoint.

        min- or max-width for Mobile or Desktop
        Last week we learned how to follow mobile-first design, sketching and wireframing mobile layouts first, before desktop versions. But as long as we finalize mobile designs first, it doesn't actually matter which we code first. (But your future employer or internship company may have their own workflow preferences.)

        And, conveniently enough, the version we opt to code first will dictate how we set breakpoints! Here are helpful rules to reference:

        If you begin coding the mobile layout first, write breakpoints using min-width, because you'll be moving from smaller mobile screens up toward larger desktop screens.

        If you start with desktop, write them with max-width, because you'll move from a larger desktop viewport into a smaller mobile screen.

        (If min-width and max-width don't ring a bell, review rules for these expressions in the Viewports and Media Queries lesson.)

        Other Considerations
        But these are just the basics of responsive breakpoints and media queries. You'll see lots of tutorials online suggesting different approaches. We think the recommendations here are easiest and most efficient for beginners, but as you grow more comfortable with responsive design, feel free to try different approaches!
      </div>
      <div class="weekend-5">
        As we've already discussed, responsive web layouts are composed of three primary ingredients:

A flexible, grid-based layout
Flexible images and media
Media queries
The last lesson discussed media queries. But what about that first item on this list? In this lesson we'll discuss what a flexible grid is, what they do, and how they helps create the dynamically-responsive layouts users have grown to expect.

Flexible (or Fluid) Grids
The term flexible grid was also introduced by Ethan Marcotte (yep, same person who coined responsive design) in an article titled Fluid Grids. The article tells the story of redesigning a client's content-heavy site. The client wanted their design to resize with the browser window, but this created a serious hurdle for Marcotte...you see, there simply weren't any grid-based responsive options in 2009. They were all very rigid. So he had to develop his own.

After a series of attempts he found a solution:

...as I was working on relative font sizing, that’s when it hit me: every aspect of the grid--and the elements laid upon it--can be expressed as a proportion relative to its container...This will allow us to convert our design’s pixel-based widths into percentages, and keep the proportions of our grid intact as it resizes.

In short, we’ll have a fluid grid.

This is an important distinction. Fluid/flexible grids do not inherently refer to flexboxes, or even a feature called CSS grids (we'll explore what CSS grids are in the next lesson). They're a general type of layout that has existed long before either of these features. We could create a flexible grid using CSS grid or flexbox features, sure, but they're not the only way.

(Essentially, just keep in mind "flexible grid" is a general term, whereas CSS Grid and Flexbox are specific features in CSS.)

Marcotte provides an example in his Fluid Grids article. Check out the following web layout. Pretty standard, right?



Here's that same layout with grid lines superimposed:



Notice how the different elements and areas of the layout line up perfectly on this grid. Then notice how each area of the grid retains proportions as the viewport resizes:



As we can see, fluid grids are the cumulative use of relative values and a media query-based grid system. The goal with any grid layout is to be structural rigid enough to organize content cleanly and consistently, yet still flexible enough to dynamically resize for any viewport.

Grids are a construct that abstract other tools. So it's admittedly difficult to write rules for how they should be used. There's no single best practice for flexible grid-based layouts. It's dependent on needs of the specific project. That said, the priorities of flexible grids lie on a spectrum;

On one end exists the snappy, rigid design focusing on displaying content in the clearest, most consistent way possible.

On the other end exist flowing grids that maintain the same viewport ratio regardless of screen size. These grids gently decrease or increase their content sizes as the browser window expands or contracts, as opposed to "snapping".

And responsive layouts can exist anywhere between these two ends of the spectrum.

Examples
Here are two examples that prioritize these goals differently. Visit each and expand/contract your browser window to observe how they change:

Deutsche & Japaner
This slick agency site has an highly-stylized grid system brimming with media. As we resize the browser window, we see grid sections are dictated by relative values (pictures, for example, take up 100%, 50%, or 25% of the screen width). At media breakpoints the grid changes shape drastically.

NPR News
In contrast, NPR's homepage uses a simple grid with lots of margin to keep content cleanly separated. Notice there are also fewer breakpoints. This prevents article titles from "snapping" or "jumping" out of visual focus, as they would if the grid changed drastically over more than three breakpoints.

What other differences do you notice between these two? Is there one you're more drawn toward? Do you think different content is best represented by different approaches? How will the grids you use maximize user experience?

This is the question inherent in responsive design.

        Now that we've been introduced to CSS grids, let's explore how they before we begin creating our own grids in class tomorrow.

This lesson will walk through CSS grid terminology, anatomy, and the properties and style declarations used to create a grid.

Grid Anatomy and Terminology
Let's first clarify CSS grid anatomy and terminology. Some of this will be review from the video in the previous lesson.

Consider the following diagram from gitconnected's article How to Get a Quick Start with CSS Grid Layout:



Let's walk through each part depicted here:

Grid Container
A grid container is the element that contains the grid itself. We create it by applying a display: grid; style to it, like this:

.example-grid {
  display: grid;
}
As soon as an element is a grid container, all its children automatically become grid items, and span the full width of the parent grid container.

Grid Items
Grid items are simply the items organized by the grid. They must be direct children of the grid container. All direct children of grid containers are automatically grid items.

Grid Lines
Grid lines are the intersecting lines that make up the grid itself.

There are column lines that run top-to-bottom;

and row lines that run right-to-left, as seen in the image above.

Grid Cell
A grid cell is an individual "box" in the grid (one of the nine squares composing the grid seen above).

Grid Track
A grid track is the space between two adjacent grid lines. Each entire row or column in the grid is considered a grid track.

Grid Area
Grid area refers to the combined area of multiple cells (but it must be a rectangle, and cannot be an L-shape. See diagram above.)

Grid Gap
Grid gap refers to optional space between each column and row, as emphasized in the image below (it's not included in the diagram above). Sometimes specifically referred to as column gap, or row gap.

      <div class="weekend-7">
        Now that we've discussed several different tools and approaches for responsive design, like flexbox, media queries, relative units, and more, let's begin to explore the differences between these approaches.

        In this lesson we'll observe examples of different responsive design principles in action, in order to see and understand the different effects they create in the browser. This should help us make informed decisions about what responsive principles should be applied to which of our projects, depending on desired outcome.

        Responsive Design Case Studies
        Below are three simple websites. Each has the exact same content, maintains a generally consistent aesthetic, and is responsive. However, we've used a different combination of tools and CSS rules in each of to observe their differences.

        Using this Lesson
        Each of the following headers links to the stylesheet used in its example. As you read through each example's benefits and drawbacks, visit the stylesheet and observe what styles are used, and how the three differ.

        1. Fluid Layout with Relative Units


        This example presents responsive content without media queries or grids. Instead, we're only using relative units to transform content to fit different viewport sizes.

        As discussed in the Relative Units lesson, padding, border, and container values are set with px, but other values are percentages of either a parent element (using relative percentage % values) or the viewport (using viewport units vw).

        Notice the font-size for the entire document is a function of vw. This makes the text size responsive.

        Also, as in more traditional box model styling, the dimensions of the parent content elements (.header, .content-big, and .content-small) all derive their dimensions from the content itself, instead of being set explicitly.

        This can be an effective way to style a page with static text that doesn't change. But much of what makes this layout fluid will also make it difficult to retain its shape.

        For example, if content ever changes, or the layout must shift in small ways, writing explicit rules into this stylesheet will cause challenges. What if, for example, we want .content-big to be a perfect square in all orientations?

        2. Multiple Layouts with Media Queries


        We learned it's best practice to use relative units like em, rem, and % for text and page content as much as possible. This next stylesheet intentionally breaks that rule to demonstrate what a media query achieves for us. It uses only media queries, and no relative values.

        Notice the different layouts we see between each breakpoint are entirely static. They only "snap" from one layout to the next when breakpoints are applied, and do not gently expand or shrink with the viewport like the previous example.

        The only content that shifts with the window size is the header, because its display is block by default, and automatically takes up 100% of its parent width.

        There's nothing seriously wrong with this approach either. But part of modern web design is creating layouts that work well for text and media content. What would happen if this project included a banner image before the main content?

        3. Relative Units, Media Queries, and Flexbox


        This third approach uses relative units, media queries, and flexbox together. This allows us to exploit both fluid content and grid systems, giving us the best combination of readable content and fluid transitions between layouts.

        Although this page doesn't include images, the structure of its stylesheet would be easy to adapt to include fluid images, which we'll discuss further in the next lesson.

        Also, by using the media queries and grids, it's easier for us to follow best practices of "Outside In".

        Adding Responsiveness to Your LHTP Makeover
        You spent three days last week using the Web Design Process to create your own version of this very site, LearnHowToProgram.com. Today, practice responsive design by integrating concepts from this weekend's homework into last week's LHTP project.

        First, review each partner's project from last week, and determine which you'll integrate responsiveness into.

        Beginning with your home/landing page, review mobile and desktop wireframes and prototypes. After learning about responsive design, do you have new ideas about how to structure these views? Or does the existing layout already fulfill best practices of responsive design? If necessary, return to the sketches, wireframes and prototypes, and update them to better reflect responsive design.

        Next, craft the necessary HTML, CSS, and Sass to create the coded version of this view. To fully focus on responsive design, don't use any styles you wrote last week. Instead, begin from scratch, focusing on integrating responsiveness and concepts from this weekend's homework at each step.

        Repeat this process for each additional page in your project. You likely won't have enough time to build every page. That's 100% okay, and anticipated. Don't focus on finishing, focus on crafting elegantly-responsive user interfaces.

      <div class="monday-2">
        Imagine we're front end developers at a large company that creates and maintains huge apps and websites. Each has hundreds of pages, tons of Sass styles, and countless interfaces to be designed and maintained.

Now imagine these applications used only the HTML, CSS/Sass and JavaScript techniques we've covered so far. Their index.html pages could have hundreds of script tags, each loading a necessary file or tool (like Bootstrap, jQuery, and more). This would be messy. It would also be slow. You see, each of those files takes time to load. Time that adds up quickly. And if a site takes too long to load, many users just leave, losing the company customers and revenue.

This is a real-life struggle for many companies. In fact, Amazon estimated a single second of lag time would cost them a staggering $1.6 billion in yearly sales. Similarly, Google has determined their traffic drops by 20% if search results take an extra half second to load! In a world where technology responds increasingly fast, users just don't wait. So it's up to us, the developers, to ensure speedy load times.

One common way to decrease load time is to put all code (both code written by developers, and code for outside tools like jQuery or Bootstrap) into a single file. This is called bundling or module bundling. It's quicker because the browser only has to load one file. This is faster than loading hundreds of smaller files linked in script> tags, even if the single file is pretty hefty.

Bundling code like this is really common nowadays. So we're going to practice it too. But we must first set up a development environment to handle this process. Let's learn about them now.

Modern JavaScript Development
This lesson will discuss three of the most important pieces of a modern development environment: dependencies, package managers, and module bundlers. We'll learn what they do, why developers use them, and associated vocabulary. Then in the next few lessons we'll walk through creating our own development environment together.

Dependencies
Do you remember importing Bootstrap into projects in Intro? Or downloading and linking a jQuery file? These outside tools contained code we didn't write. But we weren't plagiarizing! This code is free and available for anyone to use.

Pieces of outside code we bring into our projects like this are called dependencies. There are outside libraries (chunks of code designed around a specific purpose that we can bring into a project as a dependency) for almost anything! For instance, a package called Moment helps gracefully work with dates and times, libraries like documentation.js help auto-generate documentation for big projects, and dependencies like Animate.css even create CSS animations. (But don't worry about these right now, they're just examples.)

Cool thing is, anyone can publish a library for others to use as a dependency! Whether a big dev team at a well-known company (like the React library created by Facebook), or a single developer working on a tool at home.

Package Managers
We practiced locating, downloading, and linking files for Bootstrap and jQuery into our projects in Intro to Programming. But there's actually a much easier, quicker, and more efficient way to handle this. Something called a package manager allows us to download and install dependencies directly through the command line!

Package managers also automatically create and maintain a file called a manifest that lists all installed dependencies. It automatically updates this list as we add or remove dependencies, so we always know what's installed. The manifest ensures other developers who clone our project download and install the correct dependencies in their copy too.

Module Bundler
A module bundler collects all project source code and concatenates it into a big central file. Using a module bundler has recently become best practice for several reasons:

Decreased load time. Projects often use many tools. Each must be imported into the project and/or loaded with script> tags. The browser loads them individually, which takes time. But combining code from all dependencies into one file (known as a bundle) decreases this load time dramatically, because the browser must only load a single file.

Minified code. Most bundlers also minify code. Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments, etc.); things that humans need to easily read code, but computers do not. Removing these characters makes our file smaller. Smaller files load faster. If you've ever seen a file (like a Bootstrap stylesheet) with .min in the name you've encountered minified code.

Now that we have an general understanding of dependencies, package managers, and module bundlers, we'll begin creating our own development environment in the next lesson, as we walk through installing and using a package manager together.

        With your pair, visit a few websites each of you commonly uses. Resize their windows slowly, to determine how they're responsive. What changes? How do they accommodate smaller screen sizes? Can you spot anything you think may be a CSS grid? Discuss with your partner.

        Grid Garden
        Similar to the Flexbox Froggy and Flexbox Defense games we started class off with yesterday, begin warming up your new CSS Grid skills by playing the CSS Grid Garden game with your partner.

        Just like yesterday, make sure to switch off with your partner between levels and pay attention to helpful hints at the top of the page.

        Mondrian Painting
        Piet Mondrian is regarded as one of the most famous and influential abstract artists of the 20th century, most commonly associated with the grid-like paintings he produced in in the 1920's.

        Watch the following video, where Jen Simmons from Mozilla walks through recreating a Mondrian painting in CSS grid. Follow along to recreate your own version of this painting in CSS grid.


        Adding Responsiveness to Your LHTP Makeover
        You spent three days last week using the Web Design Process to create your own version of this very site, LearnHowToProgram.com. Today, practice responsive design by integrating concepts from this weekend's homework into last week's LHTP project.

        First, review each partner's project from last week, and determine which you'll integrate responsiveness into.

        Beginning with your home/landing page, review mobile and desktop wireframes and prototypes. After learning about responsive design, do you have new ideas about how to structure these views? Or does the existing layout already fulfill best practices of responsive design? If necessary, return to the sketches, wireframes and prototypes, and update them to better reflect responsive design.

        Next, craft the necessary HTML, CSS, and Sass to create the coded version of this view. To fully focus on responsive design, don't use any styles you wrote last week. Instead, begin from scratch, focusing on integrating responsiveness and concepts from this weekend's homework at each step.

        Repeat this process for each additional page in your project. You likely won't have enough time to build every page. That's 100% okay, and anticipated. Don't focus on finishing, focus on crafting elegantly-responsive user interfaces.

        Peer Code Review
        Design is responsive, and dynamically resizes into a mobile-friendly layout.
        Best practices of responsive design are followed, including using relative units, designing mobile layouts first, integrating media queries to dynamically reorganize and resize content, and integrating images fluidly.
        Styles are written in Sass syntax, and well-refactored using Sass functionality.
